Automates the full text harvesting of dataset citations from various full text article databases, 
including Scopus, PLOS, and Springer.

## Installation

### Released version

```
remotes::install_github("DataONEorg/scythe@v0.9.0")
```

The *scythe* R package should be available for use at this point.

### Development version

Development versions can be installed from GitHub.

```
remotes::install_github("DataONEorg/scythe@develop")
```

## Quick Start

To set API keys for use in the package, see the section below on authentication.

```
library(scythe)
scythe_set_key(source = "scopus", secret = "YOUR KEY")

identifier <- "10.18739/A22274"
results <- citation_search(identifier)
```

### Authorization Credentials & API Key Management

The function `scythe_set_key()` manages API keys using the [`keyring`](https://github.com/r-lib/keyring) package. `keyring` uses your operating system's credential store to securely keep track of key-value pairs. Running `scythe_set_key()` for the first time will prompt you to set a password for your keyring, should you need to lock or unlock it.

#### Scopus

To obtain a Scopus API key, make an account at the [Elseviers Developers Portal](https://dev.elsevier.com/) and create API key. Once you've obtained your key, you can use `scythe_set_key()` to securely set your key. This key is accessed in the `citation_search()` function, but you can also retrieve the value using `keyring::key_get()`.

```
scythe_set_key(source = "scopus", secret = "YOUR_KEY")
keyring::key_get("scopus", keyring = "scythe")
```

#### Springer

The Springer Nature API key is available by creating an application [here](https://dev.springernature.com/admin/applications) after signing up for an account. The key can be set and retrieved using:

```
scythe_set_key(source = "springer", secret = "YOUR_KEY")
keyring::key_get("springer", keyring = "scythe")
```
